    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bun</li>
        <li>100% all aussie beef pattie</li>
        <li>lettuce</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a slow cooker to Low.</li>
        <li>Create a rack for the bottom of the cooker by rolling 
            aluminum foil into 1-inch rolls. 
            For a 5-quart, oblong cooker, make 4 rolls, using the length of the cooker as a guide. 
            Fold in any long ends and squeeze back on the rolls. 
            venly space the rolls along the bottom of the cooker.</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, steak seasoning, smoked paprika, salt,
             and pepper in a bowl. Add bread crumbs and egg. 
            Mix all ingredients using your hands until they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Form meat mixture into 4 patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Brush each side of the patties 
            with 1/2 teaspoon of browning sauce, 
            and place on the aluminum "rack", being careful not to overlap.</li>
        <li>Cook on Low for about 4 1/2 hours until burgers are no longer pink in the center. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
            should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place each cooked patty on a hamburger bun.</li>
    </ol>
