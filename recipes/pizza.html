    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza Image">
    <p>A napolitania classic and favourite among the locals. 
        Thou simple in ingredients it packs a punch in taste. 
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Base</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Salami</li>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. 
            Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, 
            about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough. 
            Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, 
            adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic but not sticky, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch circles; 
            they do not need to be perfect.</li>
        <li>Brush both sides of crust with additional oil. Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. 
            Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is lightly browned and top looks set. 
            Using long handled tongs, remove crust from grill, grilled side up, to a platter or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Lightly add sauce and top the grilled side of each pizza crust. 
            Excess sauce or toppings makes the pizza hard to handle. 
            Repeat with remaining pizzas.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide each pizza onto the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes 
            until bottom of crust is browned and cheese is melted. 
            Remove from grill and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
